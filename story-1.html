    <h1>Blurrg & Nervura</h1>
    <p>
The swamps of Nazmir were alive with shadows. Mist curled around gnarled roots and stagnant pools, hiding all manner of secrets. Nervura moved silently, boots sinking slightly into the muddy ground, her bow strung and ready. But her mind was heavy, weighed down by the ghosts of her past. <br><br>

She whispered under her breath, a quiet litany of guilt. Teldrassil… burning… Silvermoon… lost friends… blood on my hands… She had once been a ranger under Sylvanas, a soldier in a war that demanded everything and left nothing but sorrow. She didn’t want to be that person anymore. She wanted to move forward, quietly, carefully, without leaving more blood in her wake. <br><br>

A sound snapped her from her reverie. A creak, a shuffle, a faint whimper. Nervura froze, flattening herself against a rotting root. Peering through the mist, she saw a carriage approaching. Its riders: Blood Trolls, twisted and cruel, cracking whips at the hulking crawgs pulling the cart. Her stomach knotted as she spotted tiny whimpers from inside—the stolen resources she had tracked were accompanied by helpless baby crawglings.      <br><br>

She exhaled slowly. Not this time. <br><br>

With the precision born of years of practice, she let her arrow fly. It pierced a troll’s heart, and he slumped silently. Eleven more remained, their blood magic pulsing in the shadows. She fired again, but her quiver emptied too quickly. Explosives were out of the question—she wouldn’t harm the crawgs. <br><br>

The trolls advanced, snarling and swinging. One massive troll with a wicked spear lunged at her. Her breath hitched. She was outnumbered, and the swamp was unforgiving. <br><br>

Then—movement. One of the crawgs broke free from the carriage, charging straight at the massive troll. With a bone-jarring headbutt, the beast sent him sprawling. Nervura’s heart leapt. She froze, eyes locking with the crawg’s. Determination burned in his wide, intelligent eyes. Loyalty. Courage. <br><br>

She nodded imperceptibly. We’ll work together. <br><br>

The crawg clamped its jaws onto the fallen spear and hurled it toward her. With a swift pivot, she struck true. Together, they tore through the remaining trolls, a perfect blend of cunning and brute force. By the time the last troll fell, silence returned, broken only by the soft whimpers and squeaks of the surviving baby crawglings. <br><br>

Nervura crouched beside a small tabby-grey crawg, letting it sniff her hand. The others swarmed around, celebrating their unlikely savior. She chuckled softly. “You are quite a beast, little fighter,” she murmured. <br><br>

The crawg’s nose twitched at the rare bloodsausage among her recovered supplies. She handed him a piece—but he nudged it gently toward the babies instead. She laughed, giving him another portion and some soothing headpets. <br><br>

Then something remarkable happened. The crawg locked eyes with her, large amber eyes glimmering with purpose. He stepped closer, lowered his massive head in a gesture that was unmistakably a proposal. A deep, resonant sound rolled from his throat, vibrating through the swamp: <br><br>
 
“Mind joining me? We can protect the crawgs together.” <br>

Nervura blinked, heart skipping. She looked at him, really looked, and saw more than a beast—she saw a partner, a kindred spirit, a chance to redefine herself. <br><br>

“Yes,” she whispered, voice steady, though her chest swelled with a mix of awe and hope. “Yes, we will protect them. Together.” <br><br>

Blurrg nudged her hand gently, the beginnings of a bond that would change both their lives forming in the swampy mist. The unlikely duo—ranger and Bloodbeast—stood among the roots and fog, a silent promise made: to defend the innocent, to fight as one, and to leave behind the shadows of their past. <br><br>

From that day on, the swamps of Nazmir were never quite so lonely—or quite so dangerous—for those who deserved protection. <br><br>
