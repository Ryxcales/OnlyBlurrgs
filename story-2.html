    <h1>Maroel: Love at Arms</h1>
    <p>
    In the world of Azeroth, there was the prestigious guild known as Conundrum: where anyone could be anything. <br>
    Yet despite the many possibilities, a human man chose to be a Warrior. Indeed, among his more magical and colorful comrades this human warrior stood tall, distinguishing himself with his less than polished armor (a sign of many a battle indeed!) and his massive dual wielding swords that sounded like hurricanes each time he swung them. The more than basic Human Warrior always did the most damage in every adventuring party he was invited to. And the days he wasn’t the number one, well….who’s to say those numbers are all that accurate anyway? <br><br>

    In one of his latest ventures, Maroel and co. was leading the charge against Gallywix and his goons in the latest raid at the time: The Undermine! In the midst of a somewhat successful battle, the Guild Conundrum came across their toughest challenge yet: Heroic Mug’Zee! At the time a couple of their comrades were missing, and in their stead a few new faces arrived. One of these adventurers is the Vicious Huntress Nervura, a skillful fighter in her own right, with her trusty pet companion Blurrg by her side. She carried an epic spear and wore mail armor with golden hues, wreathed in fur and fangs of the game she hunted. <br><br>

    Maroel didn’t notice her, he was busy with reviewing the latest strategies or admiring himself from the reflection of his shiny swords. When the boss was pulled he got to slashing and dashing, slicing and dicing through the battlefield. Trying to decapitate not one but two heads of Mug’Zee, this was practically double the fun! At one point while trying to maneuver around the battlefield Maroel quickly jumped away from an explosion and decided to charge back into the closest thing he saw between all the smoke and lightning blasts. <br><br>

    As he charged in he suddenly felt like he was stopped when he reached his target. At that moment he came face to face with Nervura. After locking eyes they then both immediately realized that he was actually frozen in a solid ice cube. Maroel had tanked a magical icicle missile meant for Nervura. At the very last moment, the magnificent, mighty Maroel charged in and totally blocked the devastating spell. Or rather, it looked like he was just in the way. But it was definitely intentional. <br><br>

    The elf woman quickly gathered herself and ran back into the fight. Without even a thanks, too! At this point the elf woman was sprinting away with Blurrg in tow, who briefly glanced back at him. Now having been stunned in more than one way, Maroel quickly gathered his wits and realized that he had to sit idle in the ice block while his friends killed the boss in a totally epic and awesome fashion. He was annoyed with his situation but had to play it cool (no pun intended). <br><br>

    “That woman, she must’ve done it on purpose!” he thought. “To me beat on the damage, that must be it!”. After what felt like eternity Mug’Zee was defeated. As the boss fell and Maroel was unfrozen, Maroel found himself now wet and on the ground in the fetal position. “Kinda embarrassing”, he thought. <br><br>

    When he looked up a shadow fell on his face and a hand gloved in mail armor accompanied by a soothing, elegant voice: “I’m sorry, are you alright?” Crimson hair, jade eyes and a soft pale face: it was the Huntress Nervura, his semi-accidental imprisoner from the encounter, Goddess. Although for some reason her face was more red than before…a wound sustained in battle perhaps. <br><br>

    As Maroel grabbed the reaching hand he felt his whirlwind of emotions melt away just as the block of ice. Perhaps a new emotion has taken their place. As he got up, their eyes were once again locked. He barely managed to utter the words: “Thank you”. <br><br>
