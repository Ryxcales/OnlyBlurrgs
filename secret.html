    <h1>Congrats, you found the secret story!</h1>
    <p>
In the world of Azeroth, there was the prestigious guild known as Conundrum, where anyone could be anything. <br>

Yet despite the many possibilities, a girl chose to simply be a girl. A more confident, stronger, and way more badass version of herself, the one she aspired to be. And of course, she didn’t want to be alone on her adventures, so this mighty Huntress needed a sidekick, like all badass characters have. In this case, it was a Blurrg. <br><br>

You may ask what a Blurrg is? It’s a blood-magic-altered frog, giant fangs, long legs, and a loyal soul. That’s all you need to know for now. Blurrg fights by Nervura’s side, the fangs to her spear, which they sometimes use to play fetch. But that’s all for another story. <br><br>

There were as many Hunters in this world as sand on the beach, so she often lacked confidence as she wasn’t part of the main group. But she was up for every challenge, trying to prove her worth and cunning to conquer her enemies. <br><br>

In one of their latest ventures, the unlikely duo participated in the charge against Gallywix and his goons in the latest raid at the time, The Undermine. <br>

In the midst of a somewhat successful battle, the guild Conundrum came across their toughest challenge yet, Heroic Mug’Zee. <br><br>

Nervura was nervous. She was standing in for a sick guild member, the other 24 battle-hardened fighters knew exactly what to do, they had beaten this boss before. Nervura had studied the guides, memorized the tactics, but she had never fought him herself. <br><br>

She stood by the entrance, peeking at her notes, when a tall presence passed by. She looked up and saw <strong>him</strong>. <br><br>

He was tall, handsome, and had shoulder armor far bigger than anyone could reasonably need. His two weapons were polished to perfection, she could smell the faint after-scent of paraffin as he passed, not even noticing her. But she noticed him. <br><br>

It was Maroel, the Warrior of her guild. She had always seen him, not just on the damage meter, but as the red-haired half-elf who somehow stood out to her. <br><br>

Lost in thought, she completely forgot to check her notes. Blurrg headbutted her, his little eyes saying, “Focus on the boss, green-ear!” <br><br>

And he was right. <br><br>

The timer went down. Nervura frantically grabbed her bombs and laid them out for the pull. Dodge bullets, place ground thingy outside, if he targets you with Icebolt, hide behind the wall… can’t be that hard. <br><br>

And so the fight began. Nervura clenched her spear, trying to mimic the other melee fighters in her camp. They were all far more experienced, she needed to keep up with them to master the fight.<br><br>

In the corner of her eye, she saw him again, the Warrior, dashing through enemies, his weapons thundering with each strike, casually dealing the most damage in the party. His lips were pressed together in focus, and she felt a surge of motivation. She wanted to try harder, to be noticed, make it above the tanks maybe even make it into the top five on the meters.<br><br>

Then it happened.<br><br>

She got a mechanic. No panic. She’d seen the guide. If you get the Icebolt, hide behind the wall, wait for it to shatter, then return to the fight.<br><br>

No biggie, right?<br><br>

In a rush, she disengaged, but tripped over an empty patron on the ground, ruining her landing and crashing against the wall. The world spun, she was dizzy. There was no way she could make it behind cover in time. Her Turtle was on cooldown, and Feign Death wouldn’t save her this time. She was done for.<br><br>

Blurrg looked at her, a mix of judgment and concern in his tiny eyes.<br><br>

She’d die like a noob again. Frustration clawed at her chest. It was the easiest mechanic… how could I mess it up again?<br><br>

In panic, she looked between the boss, Blurrg, the incoming Icebolt, and the wall. It all happened in seconds. She closed her eyes, bracing for the impact that would encase her in ice.<br><br>

She waited.<br><br>

And waited.<br><br>

…But she wasn’t frozen.<br><br>

Opening her eyes, she saw him. He had thrown himself in front of her, taking the hit meant for her. Their gazes met. Why had he done that? Did he protect her on purpose? Was he saving her from embarrassment… or the bench? It didn’t seem very Him of him?!<br><br>

But there was no time to think. The fight raged on. Nervura picked up her spear and rejoined the fray.<br><br>

After the battle, one she had survived this time, Nervura was torn. Should she ask him? Ask why he’d tanked the spell? What if it had just been an accident? Would she even want to know that?<br><br>

Blurrg gave her that knowing look, as if saying, “Gurl.” <br><br>

She sighed, patting his head and rewarding him with a snack. <br><br>

Probably, the Warrior had just been in the way. But she should at least thank him. <br><br>

She walked over to the freshly defrosted pile of plate armor crouched on the floor. His hair was wet from the melting ice, falling in red streaks across his face, his lips and nose slightly rosy. Nervura blushed as she reached out to help him stand. <br><br>

“I’m sorry, are you alright?” she asked, feeling guilty… and something else, a fluttering warmth in her chest, as he reached for her hand. <br><br>

The touch was firm. His hands were cold yet soft. He stood up quickly, unnaturally fast for someone wearing that much armor. The touch was brief… too brief… but it left her heart racing. <br><br>

She looked up anyway, despite her shyness. His face was stern, unreadable, and he simply said, in a neutral tone:

“Thank you.” <br><br>

And that’s how Nervura and the more-than-basic Human Warrior Maroel broke the ice. <br><br>     <em>— Nervura, she is just a girl</em>
