    <h1>Detective Blurrg <br>
    in the missing Bloodpudding!</h1>
    <p>
A Halloween Special from the Swamps of Nazmir <br><br>

It was a foggy evening in the Nazmir swamps. The moon glowed pale and crooked, the mist hung thick, and the frogs croaked strange little tunes that made even brave hunters shiver. Nervura had just finished decorating their cozy crawg-cabin with cobwebs, pumpkin lanterns, and little bone charms when… she made a terrible discovery.<br><br>

Her entire stash of Bloodpudding was gone. Every single jar. <br><br>

Nervura gasped, her eyes wide. “Blurrg! Someone stole it!”<br><br>

From the shadows, a small figure stepped forward — wearing a little detective hat slightly too big for his horns. His tiny eyes gleamed with purpose.<br><br>

“Detective Blurrg… on the case.” serious croak<br><br>

Scene 1: The Interrogations <br><br>

He started where every good detective starts — with the usual suspects.<br><br>

First up: Blurrgina. <br>
Elegant, powerful, and polishing her fangs in the moonlight.<br><br>

Blurrg squinted. “Blurrgina… where were you at snack o’clock?” <br>
She smirked. “Training. You think I’d steal your pudding, darling?” <br>
Blurrg sniffed. The scent of battle and swamp roses… but no pudding. <br>
“Hmmm. Alibi checks out. For now.” suspicious croak <br><br>

Next: Blurg, his loud, chaotic cousin. <br>
“Blurg! You like snacks. You like stealing snacks. Confess!”  <br>
Blurg puffed out his chest. “I don’t need your pudding! I have meat! Real meat!” <br>
He flexed. Something squelched in his armor. <br>
Blurrg leaned closer. “…That’s pudding on your shoulder.” <br>
Blurg blinked. “Oh. That’s… dirt.” <br>
Blurrg glared for a solid five seconds, then scribbled on his “detective notes” (a leaf with mud scribbles). <br>
“Suspicious… but too obvious.” hmm croak <br><br>

Then: Blurgette, the shy one. <br>
Blurrg softened his voice. “Little one… did you see anything strange?” <br>
She shook her head, clutching a shiny rock. “No, Detective… but… I did see footprints. Big ones. Going that way.” <br>
She pointed toward the swamp path — the one leading deeper into the mist. <br>
Blurrg’s eyes narrowed. <br>
“The plot… thickens.” dramatic croak <br><br>

Scene 2: The Swamp Chase <br><br>

Blurrg followed the trail through the fog. The footprints were wide, the scent strong — and sticky. Definitely pudding residue. <br>
Thunder rumbled. Fireflies flickered like tiny souls. <br>
He pressed on, sneaking past vines and puddles, his detective hat slightly crooked but his resolve steady. <br><br>

Then — he found it. A clue!<br><br>
An empty pudding jar. And a receipt.<br><br>

“5 crates of Bloodpudding — purchased by: ‘Mysterious Customer’.” <br>
The signature was a doodle of… a horned smiley face? <br><br>

Blurrg gasped. <br>
He sniffed the jar. <br>
Then his eyes widened. <br><br>

He knew that scent. <br><br>

He followed it back — through the swamp, past the lilypads, around the big haunted tree, and all the way to… <br><br>

His and Nervura’s house. <br><br>


Scene 3: The Big Reveal <br><br>

The door creaked open. The room was dark. <br>
Blurrg tensed, fangs ready. “Whoever you are… drop the pudding!” <br><br>

Then — light exploded! <br><br>

“Surprise!!!” <br><br>

Confetti of flower petals fell everywhere. Tiny crawglings cheered and waved glowing mushrooms. Nervura stood in the center, smiling wide, wearing a little witch hat with fangs stitched on the brim. Blurrgina, Blurg, and Blurgette all stood by the table — which was absolutely covered in Bloodpudding, pumpkin pies, swamp treats, and spooky decorations. <br><br>

Blurrg froze. <br>
Then blinked. <br><br>

“What… what is this…?” confused croak <br><br>

Nervura knelt down, grinning. “It’s a surprise, silly. We tricked you so we could treat you. It’s our Halloween party — to celebrate you and all the crawglings’ first Trick and Treating night!” <br><br>

The little crawglings surrounded him, bouncing, glowing mushrooms in hand. <br>
One of them squeaked, “Detective Blurrg! Detective Blurrg! Solve the pudding mystery?” <br>

He puffed up proudly, hat slightly tilting to one side. <br>
“Yes. Case closed. Criminals… all guilty of kindness.” happy croak <br><br>

Nervura laughed. “Come on, Detective. Let’s celebrate.” <br>
She handed him a bowl of Bloodpudding topped with little sugar bats. <br><br>

Blurrg blinked once. Then twice. <br><br>

He took a heroic spoonful.
Then raised it high.

“To Halloween… and to pudding justice!” <br><br>
 
The crawgs cheered, Nervura smiled, and in the background, Blurg tripped into a cauldron of slime — which only made the party better. <br><br>

Outside, fireflies danced like flickering candles, and the swamp shimmered in purple light. <br>

And if you listened closely, through the fog and laughter, you could still hear it… <br>

content, victorious croak. <br><br>
