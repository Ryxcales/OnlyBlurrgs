  2: ["He puffs himself up, tail twitching. The message is clear: you’ve entered his swamp, and he’s not impressed.", emotes.angry],
  3: ["Blurrg lets out a wet snort, turning away dramatically. You are beneath his notice.", emotes.angry],
  4: ["He gives your boots a cautious sniff, as though deciding whether you’re foe… or snack?!", emotes.snack],
  5: ["Blurrg’s tiny eyes squint suspiciously. He doesn’t move, but you can feel him silently judging your life choices.", emotes.happy],
  6: ["He tilts his head, croaking once. He hasn’t decided yet if you’re dangerous—or just weird.", emotes.happy],
  7: ["Blurrg circles you slowly, nostrils flaring. He’s searching for something… maybe food, maybe a reason to care.", emotes.snack],
  8: ["He lets out a sharp croak, as if to say, “You may proceed… for now.”", emotes.happy],
  9: ["Blurrg blinks slowly, clearly unimpressed. He sits down mid-stare, as if you’ve already bored him.", emotes.sleepy],
  10: ["Blurrg gives you a curious sniff. He keeps watching, unblinking. Neutral feelings.", emotes.happy],
  11: ["Blurrg sniffs at your bag and gives a soft croak—he definitely smells food. You’re gaining points.", emotes.snack],
  12: ["He leans forward slightly, tiny eyes glinting with curiosity. There’s potential here.", emotes.love],
  13: ["Blurrg croaks once, short and firm. Acknowledgment… or warning? Hard to say.", emotes.happy],
  14: ["He pokes your leg with his snout. A test. “Snack? Snack now?” his eyes seem to ask.", emotes.snack],
  15: ["Blurrg’s tail gives a single wag. The tension eases; you might just be earning his respect.", emotes.happy],
  16: ["He steps closer, croaking softly. You catch a glimmer of warmth in his tiny eyes—he’s considering letting you /pet.", emotes.love],
  17: ["Blurrg sits down in front of you, blinking slowly. He seems comfortable enough to stay awhile.", emotes.sleepy],
  18: ["He lets out a soft, rumbling croak of approval. You’ve passed his silent test. He deems you acceptable company.", emotes.love],
  19: ["Blurrg nudges your hand gently, his snout cold and curious. A rare sign of trust from the mighty bloodbeast.", emotes.love],
  20: ["BLURRG LOVES YOU! Blurrg’s eyes widen as you reveal a bowl of Blood Pudding. He lets out a delighted croak, tail wagging furiously. You are now, unquestionably, his favorite mortal.", emotes.love]
